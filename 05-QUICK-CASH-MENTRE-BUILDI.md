## 🎯 WHICH QUICK WIN FOR YOU?

### Decision Matrix

```
IF you want:
→ Fastest cash (24-48h) = Bug Fixing
→ Best $/hour ($70-120) = Zapier Automation
→ Most passive = Notion Templates
→ Highest total income = Do all 3
```

### Personality Fit

```
Bug Fixing: Good if you:
☐ Like troubleshooting
☐ Can work under pressure
☐ Know JavaScript well

Automation: Good if you:
☐ Like solving workflows
☐ Good at client communication
☐ Understand business processes

Templates: Good if you:
☐ Like design/organization
☐ Prefer building vs client work
☐ Patient (takes 1-2 weeks for sales)
```

---

## 🚨 COMMON MISTAKES

### MISTAKE #1: Underpricing

```
WRONG: $50 for bug fix
RIGHT: $100-200

You have Claude Code = 5x faster
Charge market rate, deliver faster
= Higher profit margin
```

### MISTAKE #2: Too Much Scope

```
WRONG: "Fix entire codebase"
RIGHT: "Fix this specific bug"

Clear scope = no scope creep
= Profitable jobs
```

### MISTAKE #3: Bad Client Selection

```
RED FLAGS:
❌ "My budget is $20"
❌ "Can you do it for free first?"
❌ "I need 50 changes for $100"

Walk away. Not worth it.
```

### MISTAKE #4: Not Asking for Reviews

```
After EVERY job:
"Happy with the result?
Would appreciate a quick review!"

Reviews = more clients = higher prices
```

---

## 📋 DAILY ROUTINE (Hybrid Model)

```
MORNING (9 AM - 12 PM): Quick Wins
☐ Check Fiverr/Upwork for orders (15 min)
☐ Outreach to 10 new prospects (30 min)
☐ Work on client jobs (2 hours)

AFTERNOON (1 PM - 5 PM): Passive Building
☐ Build FocusFlow / Product #2 (3-4 hours)

EVENING (6 PM - 8 PM): Marketing
☐ Social media posts (30 min)
☐ Respond to comments (30 min)
☐ Plan tomorrow (30 min)

RESULT:
- 2 hours quick wins = $100-300/day
- 4 hours building = passive layer growing
- Sustainable long-term
```

---

## ✅ GETTING STARTED TODAY

### NEXT 2 HOURS (Do this NOW):

```
☐ Pick your quick win (bug fixing recommended)
☐ Create Fiverr gig (45 min)
☐ LinkedIn outreach to 10 people (45 min)
☐ Set up templates in Claude Code (30 min)

DONE.

Tomorrow:
☐ More outreach (20 people)
☐ Respond to inquiries
☐ Close first client
☐ Start FocusFlow work parallel
```

---

## 🔥 REMEMBER

```
Quick wins are NOT the goal.
Passive income is the goal.

Quick wins = Runway
Runway = Time to build passive

Timeline:
Week 1-4: Heavy quick wins (fund the operation)
Week 5-8: Reduce quick wins, scale passive
Month 3+: Mostly passive, occasional quick win
Month 6: 90% passive income

Don't get stuck doing quick wins forever.
They're a means to an end.
```
