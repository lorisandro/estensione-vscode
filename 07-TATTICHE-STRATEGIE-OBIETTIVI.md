```

---

## OBIETTIVO 1: $2,000/MESE (BASELINE)

### MATH

```yaml
Opzione A - Freelance:
  8 progetti × $250 = $2,000
  O
  4 progetti × $500 = $2,000

Opzione B - Mix:
  5 progetti × $300 = $1,500
  + 1 retainer × $500 = $500
  TOTAL: $2,000

Opzione C - Passive + Active:
  Passive income: $500 (templates/extension)
  + Active: 3 progetti × $500 = $1,500
  TOTAL: $2,000
```

### TATTICA #1: VOLUME PLAY (più clienti, prezzi medi)

**TIMELINE: 30 giorni**

#### Week 1: Setup & Foundation

```markdown

```

```markdown
MATH CHECK:
Need: $2,000

```

### TATTICA #2: PREMIUM PLAY (meno clienti, prezzi alti)

**TIMELINE: 30 giorni**

#### Week 1: Positioning Premium

```markdown
Different positioning:

Instead of:
"I'm a freelance developer"

Say:
"I build [specific thing] for [specific niche] in [timeframe]"

Examples:
- "I build Chrome extensions for SaaS companies in 2 weeks"
- "I automate workflows for real estate agencies in 48 hours"
- "I fix critical bugs in production apps within 24 hours"

WHY THIS WORKS:
- Specific = premium positioning
- Timeframe = confidence
- Niche = expertise signal

PRICING:
Instead of $250-500, charge $1,000-2,000 per project

SETUP (Week 1):
☐ Niched website/portfolio
☐ Case studies (even if demo projects)
☐ Testimonials (ask friends/colleagues)
☐ "As featured in" (even if just Twitter mentions)

Target audience:
NOT: Freelance platforms (price competition)
YES: Direct outreach to companies (value competition)
```

#### Week 2-3: Premium Outreach

```markdown
TARGET: 50 qualified prospects
Definition of qualified:
- Budget exists (raised funding / profitable)
- Current pain (identified through research)
- Decision maker (CEO, CTO, Head of Product)

RESEARCH (1 hour/day):
☐ LinkedIn Sales Navigator
☐ Crunchbase (for funded startups)
☐ Product Hunt (new products = new needs)
☐ Y Combinator companies
☐ AngelList startups

OUTREACH TEMPLATE:

Subject: Quick question about [their product]

Hi [Name],

Been exploring [Product] - really like [specific feature].

Quick question: [Relevant question about their tech/process
that reveals pain point]?

I specialize in [your service] for companies like yours.
Recently helped [similar company] achieve [result].

Would you be open to a quick 15-min call to discuss?

P.S. Here's a case study: [link]

[Your name]

VOLUME:
- 5 outreach/day × 10 days = 50 total
- Response rate: 15-20% = 8-10 responses
- Call booking: 50% = 4-5 calls
- Close rate: 40% = 2 clients

2 clients × $1,500 = $3,000 (GOAL EXCEEDED)
```

#### Week 4: Delivery + Testimonial Farming

```markdown
☐ Deliver premium projects
☐ Schedule video call for testimonial
☐ Ask: "Would you recommend me to others?"
☐ Get intro to 2-3 similar companies

RESULT:
- $3,000 earned
- 2 video testimonials
- 3-5 warm intros (pipeline for Month 2)
```

---

## OBIETTIVO 2: $5,000/MESE (GROWTH)

### MATH

```yaml
Opzione A - Higher Volume:
  10 progetti × $500 = $5,000

Opzione B - Mix Price Points:
  3 progetti × $1,000 = $3,000
  + 4 progetti × $500 = $2,000
  TOTAL: $5,000

Opzione C - Retainers + Projects:
  3 retainer × $1,000 = $3,000
  + 4 one-off × $500 = $2,000
  TOTAL: $5,000

Opzione D - Passive + Active:
  Passive: $1,500 (SaaS/templates)
  + Active: $3,500 (7 progetti × $500)
  TOTAL: $5,000
```

### TATTICA #3: RETAINER CONVERSION (MRR focus)

**TIMELINE: 60 giorni**

#### Month 1: Build Client Base

```markdown
GOAL: 5-7 one-off clients

Use Tattica #1 or #2 from $2k goal
Earn: $2,000-3,000

BUT focus on:
- Client fit for retainer
- Industries with recurring needs
- Decision makers you like working with
```

#### Month 2 Week 1: Retainer Offers

```markdown
After delivering, send:

"Hey [Name],

Glad the [project] worked out well!

Quick thought: I noticed [3-5 ongoing needs]:
1. [Weekly task]
2. [Monthly optimization]
3. [Ongoing support]

Instead of ad-hoc projects, what if we did a retainer?

Proposal:
$1,000/month for:
- [X hours] dedicated time
- Priority response (within 4 hours)
- Ongoing [specific deliverables]
- Monthly strategy call

This saves you vs. project-by-project pricing,
and I can be more strategic knowing I'm in it long-term.

Interested in trying for 3 months?

[Your name]"

CONVERSION RATE: 40-50% (if they're happy with your work)

5-7 clients × 45% = 2-3 retainers

3 retainers × $1,000 = $3,000 MRR
```

#### Month 2 Week 2-4: Fill Gap with Projects

```markdown
You have: $3,000 recurring
Need: $5,000 total
Gap: $2,000

Tactics:
☐ 4 more one-off projects ($500 each)
☐ Or 2 bigger projects ($1,000 each)
☐ Or upsells to retainer clients (extra work beyond scope)

TIME BREAKDOWN:
- Retainer work: 12-15 ore/week
- New projects: 15-20 ore/week
- Marketing/sales: 5-10 ore/week
TOTAL: 32-45 ore/week (sustainable)

BY DAY 60:
$3,000 retainer + $2,000-3,000 projects = $5,000-6,000 ✓
```

### TATTICA #4: PRODUCTIZED SERVICE (scale beyond hours)

**TIMELINE: 60-90 giorni**

#### Phase 1: Identify Repeatable Process (Week 1-2)

- "Bug audit + fixes"

```

## OBIETTIVO 3: $10,000/MESE (SCALE)

### MATH

```yaml
Opzione A - High Volume:
  20 progetti × $500 = $10,000
  (NOT SUSTAINABLE - too many clients)

Opzione B - Higher Prices:
  5 progetti × $2,000 = $10,000
  (SUSTAINABLE - manageable workload)

Opzione C - Retainer Focus:
  8 retainer × $1,250 = $10,000
  (BEST - predictable MRR)

Opzione D - Mix (RECOMMENDED):
  5 retainer × $1,500 = $7,500

## TROUBLESHOOTING GUIDE

### Problem: Not Hitting Revenue Goals

```markdown
DIAGNOSIS:

Check:
1. Enough outreach volume? (Should be 50-100+/month)
2. Response rate OK? (Should be 15-20%+)
3. Close rate OK? (Should be 30-40%+)
4. Price too low? (Compare to market)

FIXES:

If outreach too low:
→ Block 1 hour/day for pure outreach
→ Use templates to speed up
→ Consider automation tools (carefully)

If response rate too low:
→ Improve personalization
→ Test different messaging
→ Target better prospects

If close rate too low:
→ Improve sales process
→ Add social proof
→ Offer guarantee
→ Lower price (temporarily)

If price too low:
→ Increase 20% for next 3 clients
→ Add premium tier
→ Focus on value, not price
```

### Problem: Too Busy, Can't Scale

```markdown
DIAGNOSIS:

Working 50+ hours but still <$5k/month?

FIXES:

1. INCREASE PRICES (immediate)
→ Raise rates 20-30% now
→ Same work, more revenue

2. CUT LOW-VALUE WORK
→ Fire bottom 20% clients
→ Stop cheap projects
→ Focus on high-value only

3. IMPROVE EFFICIENCY
→ Use Claude Code more
→ Create templates/SOPs
→ Batch similar tasks
→ Automate repetitive parts

4. DELEGATE
→ Hire VA for admin ($400/month)
→ Hire junior dev for grunt work ($800/month)
→ You focus on sales + high-value delivery
```

### Problem: Inconsistent Income

```markdown
DIAGNOSIS:

Some months $8k, some months $2k?

FIXES:

1. BUILD PIPELINE
→ Always have 5-10 warm leads
→ Even when busy delivering
→ 1 hour/day on outreach (non-negotiable)

2. ADD RETAINERS
→ Convert 30% of clients to retainer
→ Creates revenue floor
→ Smooths cash flow

3. ADD PASSIVE INCOME
→ Launch 1-2 products
→ Even $500-1,000/month helps
→ Reduces stress of feast/famine
```

### Problem: Burnout

```markdown
SYMPTOMS:
- Working nights/weekends
- Resentment toward clients
- Quality dropping
- Thinking about quitting

FIXES:

IMMEDIATE (this week):
→ Block 1 day completely off (no work)
→ Decline next 2 project inquiries
→ Extend deadline on current projects

SHORT-TERM (this month):
→ Raise prices 30% (work less or earn more)
→ Fire demanding clients
→ Add boundaries (no work after 6pm, no weekends)
→ Take 1 week off

LONG-TERM (next 3 months):
→ Shift to retainer/product model (more predictable)
→ Hire help
→ Focus on efficiency (Claude Code leverage)
→ Work 30-35 ore max (sustainable)

REMEMBER:
This is lifestyle business.
If you're miserable, you're doing it wrong.
Optimize for happiness, not just $.
