## 🎯 PORTFOLIO STRATEGY

### PRODUCT SEQUENCING

**TIMELINE RECOMMENDATION:**

```
Month 1-2: FocusFlow (leverage existing 95%)
Month 3-4: DevSync CLI or Notion Templates
Month 5-6: Social Proof SaaS (if SaaS focus)
Month 7-8: Strategic gap filler (based on learning)
Month 9-12: High-ticket offering or scale winners

DON'T launch everything at once.
Spacing = time to learn and iterate.
```

### SYNERGY BUILDING

```
Create ecosystem, not random products:

Example Portfolio:
1. FocusFlow (Chrome extension)
2. FocusFlow Mobile (companion app)
3. FocusFlow Templates (Notion productivity)
4. FocusFlow Course (productivity training)

Cross-promote:
- FocusFlow users → buy templates
- Template users → install extension
- Course students → use both

Result: 2-3x LTV per customer
```

### KILL CRITERIA

```
Kill a product if (after 6 months):

❌ <$300/mese revenue
❌ High maintenance (>5 ore/settimana)
❌ Negative reviews (<3.5 stars)
❌ No growth (flat for 3 months)
❌ Better opportunities elsewhere

Don't be emotionally attached.
Opportunity cost is real.

## 🚨 COMMON PITFALLS

### PITFALL #1: Building Too Many Products

```
WRONG: Launch 10 products in 6 months
→ All mediocre
→ No focus
→ Burnout

RIGHT: Launch 3-4 in 12 months
→ Each gets attention
→ Iterate to excellence
→ Sustainable
```

### PITFALL #2: Ignoring Marketing

```
WRONG: "Build it and they will come"
→ Great product, 0 users

RIGHT: Market from Day -30
→ Build in public
→ Waitlist before launch
→ Launch day buzz
```

### PITFALL #3: Not Killing Losers

```
WRONG: Keep dead product alive
→ Waste time maintaining
→ Opportunity cost

RIGHT: Ruthlessly cut
→ Focus on winners
→ Redirect resources
```

### PITFALL #4: Lifestyle Creep

```
WRONG: $5k/mese → spend $5k/mese
→ No cushion
→ Stress returns

RIGHT: $5k/mese → save 40%, spend 60%
→ $2k/mese saved
→ $24k/year runway
→ Can take risks
```
